The referendum divided the UK politically and socially, with a deep underlying cleavage along metropolitan-rural and generational lines. It heralded an end to decades of political consensus and brought into sharp focus long-standing issues within British society. In the aftermath, the British economy experienced a recession, while the government struggled to set out a plan for the UK's relationship with the EU after Brexit, finally culminating in a withdrawal agreement in 2019.",
